# Social Network Kata

This is my submission for the social networking kata programming test for Integral. It contains functionality for 
publishing posts to a timeline, viewing an account's personal timeline, following accounts, and viewing an aggregated
version of all timelines that a certain account is following.

src - Contains all code for my implementation.
tests - Contains all tests to test the code I have implemented.

Thank you!
